== Jenkins Plugin

=== Purpose of this plugin

This plugin enables you to start a Gatling FrontLine simulation directly from your Jenkins platform. This plugin links a Jenkins job with one and only one Gatling FrontLine simulation. +

This plugin doesn't create a new Gatling FrontLine simulation, you have to create it using the FrontLine Dashboard before.

=== Installation

To download the plugin, you need to get the hpi file located at:
----
https://downloads.gatling.io/releases/frontline-jenkins-plugin/REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_FRONTLINE_VERSION/frontline-jenkins-plugin-REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_FRONTLINE_VERSION.hpi
----

You need to be connected as an administrator of your Jenkins application to install it. Go *Manage Jenkins*, *Manage Plugins*, *Advanced*, *Upload Plugin*, and choose the hpi file.

=== Configuration

The plugin needs some global configuration. Go *Manage Jenkins*, *Configure System*, then *Global FrontLine Plugin Configuration*.

The __API Token__ will allow Jenkins to authenticate to Gatling FrontLine. To fetch the API Token, refer to the section *Managing API Tokens* in the FrontLine User Guide. +
You can configure the API Token globally in this page, or per CI project if each project has a API Token scoped on a specific team. We recommend storing the API Token in a secret text credential, but you can also copy the content of the API Token in the second field.

The __Address__ is the address of your FrontLine API, for example: http://my-website:10542. +

=== Job set-up

==== Set-up for a pipeline job (available since Jenkins 2.0)

===== Basics

You can use the Pipeline Snippet Generator to help you use the Jenkins Plugin. Click on the __Pipeline Syntax__ link, then choose the step gatlingFrontLineLauncherStep.

You can specify the id of an API Token stored in a secret text credential if you don't want to use the one configured globally. Choose one of the simulation in the drop-down, then click Generate Groovy. Copy and paste the result in your Pipeline script, eg:
[source, groovy]
----
node {
    stage("Gatling FrontLine simulation") {
        gatlingFrontLineLauncherStep credentialId: '6737158c-0ff6-4033-91ad-6f3a811aab52', '00eacd1c-ef91-4076-ad57-99b4c6675a9e'
    }
}
----

===== Passing parameters

You can also specify a custom Map of system properties which will be used in the FrontLine run. The syntax is the following:
[source, groovy]
----
gatlingFrontLineLauncherStep(simulationId: '00eacd1c-ef91-4076-ad57-99b4c6675a9e', systemProps: ["var": "$var1", "sensitive.var2": "this prop won't be displayed in the run snapshot"])
----

===== Displaying assertions as JUnit

You can display the results of the Gatling FrontLine assertions with the JUnit plugin. Add the following line:
[source, groovy]
----
junit("gatlingFrontLineJunitResults/*.xml")
----

CAUTION: If you don't have any assertions in your Gatling simulation, the JUnit step will fail.

==== Set-up for an old style job

Add a new build step called __FrontLine Plugin__. Choose in the Simulation list the simulation you want to use. You can specify the id of an API Token stored in a credential if you don't want to use the one configured globally.

You can display the results of the Gatling FrontLine assertions with the JUnit plugin.

Add a new build step called __Publish JUnit test result report__ and fill the __Test report XMLs__ input with the following line: +
`gatlingFrontLineJunitResults/*.xml`

CAUTION: If you don't have any assertions in your Gatling simulation, the JUnit step will fail.

=== Usage

A new Gatling FrontLine simulation will be started every time the job is run. Check the Console Output to check the simulation progress. If the simulation ran successfully, it will look like the following:

image::jenkins-plugin/images/jenkinsConsoleOk.png[Console View,align=center]

If the Gatling FrontLine deployment fails (i.e. because of a shortage of available hosts), the plugin will retry 3 times to redeploy the simulation.


Live metrics will be displayed in the console, and in the Status page. The link __View Run in FrontLine__ in the build page menu links to FrontLine.
