In order to log in to FrontLine, you need to have a Github account linked to FrontLine. Ask the administrator of your FrontLine platform to create one (if you're the first user, the Gatling support team has already created yours).

Pressing the "Signup with Github" button will redirect you to Github, where you will be asked to authorize the application. You need to accept it. We don't have access to any private informations or repository on your Github account.

The Github authorization page is opened in a new tab. If no tab opened, make sure that your browser didn't block it.
