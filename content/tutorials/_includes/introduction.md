## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll describe every steps needed to run your fist Simulation with Gatling Enterprise.

It all begins on [cloud.gatling.io](https://cloud.gatling.io), where a GitHub account is needed in order to connect.

You'll be able to edit your organization name afterward, but not the slug.

A new [organization]({{< ref "../../../reference/user/organization" >}}) is given **free credits** in order to **run your first simulation run**.
