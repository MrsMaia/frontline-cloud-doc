FrontLine consists of:

- A Cassandra database
- The FrontLine WebApp:
  * A rich web UI
  * A public REST API
- The FrontLine Extensions:
  * A Grafana Datasource for querying FrontLine metrics
  * Continuous Integration plugins for Jenkins, Bamboo and TeamCity or any solution that can trigger a bash script
- Gatling injectors to be used like standard Gatling OSS, with extra features so FrontLine can collect data from them

=== Document Conventions

In this document, you'll find several mentions to some placeholders in capital letters.

- REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL: the URL of the private repository that you were given alongside with your license key

WARNING: This placeholder only makes sense for on premise customers. AWS Marketplace customers spawn a pre-installed AMI and already have all the dependencies they need.

- REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_FRONTLINE_VERSION: {revnumber} at the time this document was edited
