== TeamCity Plugin


=== Purpose of this plugin

This plugin allows you to start a Gatling FrontLine simulation directly from your TeamCity platform. This plugin links a TeamCity plan with one and only one Gatling FrontLine simulation. +

This plugin doesn't create a new Gatling FrontLine simulation, you have to create it manually before.

=== Installation

To download the plugin, you need to get the zip file located at:

----
https://downloads.gatling.io/releases/frontline-teamcity-plugin/REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_FRONTLINE_VERSION/frontline-teamcity-plugin-REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_FRONTLINE_VERSION.zip
----

You need to be connected as an administrator of your TeamCity application to install it. Go __Administration__, __Plugins List__, __Upload plugin zip__, and choose the downloaded zip file.

=== Configuration

The plugin needs some global configuration. Go __Administration__, then __FrontLine__.

The __Address__ is the address of your FrontLine API, for example: http://my-website:10542. +
The __API Token__ will allow TeamCity to authenticate to Gatling FrontLine, without the need of a username or password. To fetch it, refer to the section *Managing API Tokens* in the FrontLine User Guide. +

=== Plan set-up

Add a new build step called __FrontLine Launcher__. Choose in the Simulation list the simulation you want to monitor. You need to configure the global properties of the plugin, and create at least a simulation on your FrontLine to do this step.

==== JUnit reporting

You can display the results of the Gatling FrontLine assertions as a JUnit Test.

Add a new build feature called __XML report processing__. Choose __Ant JUnit__ as report type, and enter in the __Monitoring rules__ input the following line: +
`gatlingFrontLineJunitResults/*.xml`

=== Usage

A new Gatling FrontLine simulation will be started every time the job is run. Check the Console Log to check the advancement of the simulation. If the simulation ran successfully, it will looks like the following:

If the Gatling FrontLine deployment fails (ie because of a shortage of available hosts), the plugin will retry 3 times to redeploy the simulation.


When the job run is finished, you will be able to see on the __FrontLine Results__ tab, the summary of the FrontLine simulation.
